## About Me
I develop web-based engineering apps for a large aerospace company. I received my formal training from Brigham Young University, where I earned both a Bachelors and Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. While in school, my research interests introduced me to computer programming, automation, and application development which I have been involved with ever since. 

More recently, I have been learning about leveraging cloud services to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our engineering analytical workflows. I am currently certified as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate and hope to continue adding to my proficiency in the future!

This GitHub Pages site is my first pass attempt at learning about GitHub Pages so that I can leverage it for future projects, both for work and leisure!
